## Projects & Forks

- [Plugin to Perceive the Object in Focus](https://github.com/jesseweisberg/pupil) - Real-time object-detection plugin that integrates eye-tracking (fixation data) to identify which object the user is currently fixated upon. An example of its potential is shown in controlling grasps of a robotic prosthetic hand. Part of the [Therabotics Project](https://www.jesseweisberg.com/therabotics/)
- [PolyMouse](https://github.com/trishume/PolyMouse) - PolyMouse is a fusion of gaze tracking and head tracking to achieve hands-free pointing. It does this by using eye gaze to quickly determine an imprecise area of interest and then uses small head movements to refine the position of the cursor onto a small target.
- [Asistiva](https://github.com/hookdump/asistiva) - a set of tools for creating amazing web apps optimized to be used through different input methods (i.e. including eye-tracking, head-tracking, button-less mouse, adapted switches, etc).
- [Focal](http://stewartgreenhill.com/articles/focal/) - Focal is an experimental eye-tracking musical expression controller which allows hands-free control over audio effects and synthesis parameters during performance. A see-through head-mounted display projects virtual dials and switches into the visual field.
- [Graph viz eye tracker](https://github.com/Saftophobia/graph-viz-eye-tracker) - Creating a gaze-aided graph navigating application using Unity3D and Pupil-lab.
- [Optical Dimension Spatial Thinking - ODST](https://github.com/Ruzzy77/ODST) - Gaze controlled interface using gaze data and voice recognition.
